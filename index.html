  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I am currently an undergraduate student enrolled in the University of Sydney; I am enrolled in its Bachelor of Design (Interaction Design) course. Education is my priority, especially in my current status as a student who prepares for my academic journey overseas; full preparation is consequential. Therefore, I devote most of the opportunity to working hard, being intelligent, and multitasking. My strong interest in learning new knowledge and abilities has shaped my character to carefully count my steps to strive to achieve the objectives I have set for my future.</p>
